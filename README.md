# Falsification of Cyber Physical Systems by Deep Reinforcement Learning

## What is this?

This package is to evaluate deep reinforcement learning technology for falsification of cyber-physical systems. It contains four models (an auto-transmission model, a wind turbine model, a power train control model and an insulin model. The insulin model currently does not work.

## Audience

This package is for researchers and developers who evaluates the technology.

## Reqiurment

- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Stateflow
- Decent distribution of Python
- ChainerRL 0.2.0
- s-taliro
- breach


## Agenda

- metascript.m : scripts for AT and PTC model. An insulin model is included but not working.
- metascript_cars.m : a script for CARS model
- metascript_wind_turbine.m : a script for the wind turbine model.
